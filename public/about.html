	 <h1>About Me (WIP)</h1>

  <content>
	
	<p>
	Hi, my name is Karan, and I am highly passionate about games and game development. I was introduced to games at a very young age, and continue to be fascinated by
	the stories I experience through them. <br>
	
	I started my career in the field of Machine Learning because it was the "booming" field at the time. However, after the coronavirus pandemic, I decided that I really wanted to
	figure out what I was passionate about, and make that my career.<br>
	
	I took the time to explore many different options. This process of exploration helped me understand what exactly I enjoyed.<br>
	
	The conclusion of all my exploration lead me to the Games industry, and I immediately steered myself in that direction.<br>
	
	I started studying Graphics Programming (openGL), while building solid foundations in software programming by studying native windowing libraries such as Win32 SDK (for Windows),
	X Windows Programming (for Linux), Android, webGL, openGL on iOS/macOS, and ultimately directX. I also improved my mathematical skills by studying linear algebra and calculus.<br>
	
	I also familiarised myself with existing game development engines and tools such as Unity 3D and Blender.<br>
	
	Besides gaming, I also really love movies, and books. In fact I have been part of multiple local movie and book clubs.<br>
